						these goals by focusing on inventory management and reducing
						transaction times. Josh also has experience working in the
						production office for Sarah McLachlan and Norah Jones.

					<h2>Vending</h2>
					<span class="main-content">
						Josh is a very capable vendor whose two main focuses are speed and
						customer satisfaction. Quick service results in shorter line-ups,
						more transactions during the event and a higher than normal gross.
						Customer satisfaction is important because it helps create regular
						customers and reflects positively on the artist. Contact
						<a href="mailto:joshbriand@gmail.com">Josh</a> for any of your
						vending needs in Vancouver, BC. He is also very experienced in
						warehouse management for larger events, such as stadium concerts or
