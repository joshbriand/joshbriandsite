				<span class="main-content">
					Josh is capable of managing merchandise on any size tour and had the
					 chance to demonstrate this on The Tragically Hip's Man Machine Poem

					fiscally responsible and striving to maximize sales. He achieves
					these goals by focusing on inventory management and reducing
					transaction times. Josh also has experience working in the
					production office for Sarah McLachlan and Norah Jones.

				<h2>Vending</h2>
				<span class="main-content">
					Josh is a very capable vendor whose two main focuses are speed and
					customer satisfaction. Quick service results in shorter line-ups,
					more transactions during the event and a higher than normal gross.
					Customer satisfaction is important because it helps create regular
					customers and reflects positively on the artist. Contact
					<a href="mailto:joshbriand@gmail.com">Josh</a> for any of your
					vending needs in Vancouver, BC. He is also very experienced in
					warehouse management for larger events, such as stadium concerts or
					large sporting events.
